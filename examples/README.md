# klap examples

Set of small examples to demonstrate usage of `klap`

To get started, make sure `klap` is either installed as global dependency

```bash
npm install -g klap
```

or run `npm install` in an example folder you are exploring.

Once installed, build the examples using `klap build` or `yarn build` command in example folder.

Try using `klap watch` or `yarn watch` to check live-edit-compile feature.
